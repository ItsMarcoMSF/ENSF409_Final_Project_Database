1. Make sure to add your Unit Test Files into your .gitignore to avoid uploading several unnecessary test files to the main branch. 
   Do that for all your personal files and documents that are not source codes (.class files created when testing, etc)
UPDATE: .gitignore file has been updated to exclude all .class and .jar files from being tracked. Only .java source codes
   will be tracked to commit now.
